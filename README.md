# R Subset Function Error: Unexpected Behavior with Logical Indexing

This repository demonstrates an uncommon error related to the `subset` function in R.  The issue highlights a subtle difference in how R handles logical indexing when using the `subset` function versus direct subsetting with the `[` operator.  The error can be confusing for those unfamiliar with the function's specific argument requirements.

The `bug.r` file shows the problematic code, while `bugSolution.r` provides the correct solution.  The README provides context and explains the root cause of the error.

## Issue Description:
The primary issue lies in how the `subset` function interprets column names versus the use of `$` operator.  Direct subsetting with `[` allows flexible use of column names and logical expressions.  However, `subset` requires more explicit referencing of columns when using the data frame as the first argument.

## How to reproduce the bug:
1.  Clone this repository.
2.  Open `bug.r` in an R environment.
3.  Run the code. You will observe an error in the `subset2` section related to the incorrect use of column names within the `subset` function.

## Solution:
The solution involves correctly specifying the column names within the `subset` function using the data frame's `$` notation or with the `subset` function's arguments.  Refer to `bugSolution.r` for the corrected code.
