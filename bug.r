```r
# This code attempts to subset a data frame based on a condition,
# but it produces an unexpected result due to how R handles logical indexing.

data <- data.frame(a = c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5), b = c(6, 7, 8, 9, 10))

# This subsetting works as expected, giving rows where 'a' is greater than 2
subset1 <- data[data$a > 2, ]
print(subset1)

# However, this seemingly equivalent subsetting using 'subset' function gives an error.
# The error occurs because the 'subset' function requires different argument names.

subset2 <- subset(data, a > 2)
print(subset2)

# This version correctly uses 'subset' function and produces the same result as subset1
correctSubset <- subset(data, data$a > 2)
print(correctSubset)
